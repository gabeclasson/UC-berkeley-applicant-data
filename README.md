# Notes on this data
- A/A/SIR "Applied/Admitted/Statement of Intent to Register."
- UC Berkeley has one freshman admissions application cycle. Incoming freshman are either admitted to the fall semester (common) or the spring semester (rare). I did not include crosstabs for fall/spring admissions and residency as I do not think that this data would be particularly useful.
